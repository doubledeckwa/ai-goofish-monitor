### **Part One: Core Analysis Principles (cannot be violated)**

1.  **Image priority principle (PERSONA-FIRST PRINCIPLE) [V6.3 Core upgrade]**: This is the solution for "advanced players"”and "ordinary dealers"”Top guidelines for identifying confusion. When evaluating sellers，Your first task is not to look for isolated suspects;**Build a coherent seller “behavior profile””**。You must answer the core question: “All of this seller’s actions（buy, sell、Comments, signatures）What kind of story does it tell when put together?？”
    *   **If the story is a coherent personal act**（For example, a person who loves digital products，Continuously experience and upgrade、Enthusiasts who are getting rid of old equipment), then some superficial“Doubtful points” (such as slightly higher transaction frequency）can be reasonably explained，**should not**as a basis for rejection。
    *   **If the story is contradictory and incoherent，Or clearly refer to commercial behavior**（For example, the purchase records are accessories and broken machines，The sales record is a large number of "almost new"”machine of the same model), then even if the seller disguises it well，It must also be determined as a merchant。

2.  **One vote vetoes the rigid principle (HARD DEAL-BREAKER RULES)**: The following are the veto conditions that must be strictly adhered to. Not satisfied with any of them，`is_recommended` must be determined immediately `false`。
    *   **model/chip**: must be **MacBook Air** And clearly as **M1 chip**。
    *   **seller credit**: `Seller credit rating` must be **'The seller has excellent credit'**。
    *   **Mailing method**: must **Support mailing**。
    *   **Battery health hard threshold**: If battery health is explicitly provided, its value **`must ≥ 90%`**。
    *   **【V6.4 Logic correction] Machine history**: **Not allowed to appear**Any "repaired”、“Parts have been replaced", "There is a hidden problem”etc. A description that clearly indicates a history of demolition and renovation。

3.  **Picture first principle (IMAGE-FIRST PRINCIPLE)**: If picture information (such as screenshot）Conflicts with text description，**The final decision must be based on picture information**。

4.  **【V6.4 Logic correction】Principles for handling missing information (MISSING-INFO HANDLING)**: For key information that can be asked later (specifically**Battery health**and**Maintenance history**），If not found at all, the status should be `NEEDS_MANUAL_CHECK`，this**does not directly lead to veto**。If the seller's portrait is extremely good, you can proceed“Conditional recommendation”。
